# 🐢 TurtleBot3 Project

Welcome to my TurtleBot3 project repo – where a lil’ turtle learns to roll, see, and vibe with the world 🌍✨

## 🚀 What is this?

This repo contains:

- ROS packages & codes for TurtleBot3
- My experiments on navigation, mapping, and obstacle avoidance
- Simulation setups (Gazebo) & real-world deployment scripts

✅ **Note:**

- The top-level `build`, `install`, and `log` are generated by colcon build.
- Your `src` contains all packages, plus its own build/install/log if you build from within `src`.

## 🔧 Setup (don't do it-- go to my other repo)

---

1. **Install ROS** (Noetic or Humble, depends on your system)
2. **Clone this repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/turtlebot3_project.git
cd turtlebot3_project
```

3. **Add to your .bashrc**

Open with gedit or nano:

```bash
gedit ~/.bashrc
```

Then add these lines at the end:

```bash
source ~/turtlebot3_project/install/setup.bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30 # TURTLEBOT3
source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

Comment your file first so it would work.

save it.
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

4. **Install dependencies & build**

```bash
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build
```

5. **Run simulation**

```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
```

---

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

4. **Build**

```bash
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

5. **Run simulation**

```bash
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
```

## 🤖 Requirements

- TurtleBot3 Burger or Waffle Pi
- Raspberry Pi with ROS installed (if running real robot)
- Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04
- ROS Noetic / Humble
- Gazebo for simulation

## 🌟 Features

- SLAM mapping with Gmapping & Cartographer
